## Change log

### October 2010

Initial publishing.

## Motivation

This is an old script that I’m republishing to github to tidy my house. The value of this is that you simply put some files in a filesystem, and you can receive an RSS feed of a folder and any subfolders. Not sure how much value there is to this at this era of Dropbox and other such solutions, but I wrote this before these things came around, so maybe it’s useful to someone.
